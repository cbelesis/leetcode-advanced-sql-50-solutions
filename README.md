# 🚀 LeetCode Advanced SQL 50 Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions to the **Advanced SQL** problems from the [LeetCode Advanced SQL Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/premium-sql-50/), organized by difficulty and written in **PostgreSQL**.

This complements the [LeetCode SQL 50](https://github.com/cbelesis/leetcode-sql-50-solutions) repository and focuses on more complex SQL topics, including window functions, advanced joins, CTEs, and query optimization techniques.
